# YouTube Tools
This is an archived list of various tools and software I recommended to people in the past. Most of these were fairly niche at the time of which I found them, but have become extremely popular over time.

Most of these descriptions were written by ChatGPT and may be outdated. We are not responsible for the contents of external websites. We acknowledge that other projects and services may also align with these values and encourage consumers to exercise critical thinking and evaluate each website and service on its own merits. Additionally, we disclose that we are not sponsored by any of the projects listed, and we have no other conflicts of interest to report.

You may also find the projects on the [endorsements](https://qxxst.github.io/questmatrix/endorsements) list useful. I'll probably combine that list with this one in the future.

### Vision AI
If you are wondering whether a particular thumbnail you have created is suitable for use on YouTube, you may be interested to know that Google offers a demo of their Vision AI service. This service is believed by many to be similar or identical to some of the machine learning systems used by YouTube to analyze and understand the content of images and videos. By using the demo, you can get an idea of how the thumbnail might be perceived by YouTube's algorithms and whether it might be considered safe or potentially inappropriate. This can be a useful tool for ensuring that your thumbnails comply with YouTube's policies and guidelines.

Scroll down to "Try the API" and upload an image. For our purposes, the most important information will come from the "Safe Search" tab.
### Thumbs Up
Thumbsup.tv is a website that provides a tool for testing and previewing combinations of titles and thumbnails on YouTube. This can be useful for content creators who are trying to optimize the appearance of their videos on YouTube and attract more views. By using Thumbsup.tv, you can see exactly how different title and thumbnail combinations will look on YouTube, and make informed decisions about which ones to use for your videos.

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to generate human-like text in a conversational style, based on a given prompt or conversation. ChatGPT is trained on a large dataset of human conversation and is able to understand and respond to a wide range of inputs in a coherent and appropriate manner. It is used in various applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation systems.

In the context of YouTube specifically, ChatGPT can act as a sort of "assistant" with various tasks like creating video scripts, proofreading text, generating captions, responding to comments, generating descriptions and titles, and providing general ideas for videos. Although not perfect, ChatGPT is by far the most impressive AI assistant I've ever used and thus is choice pickings for any list of important applications.

## Other
### 4K Video Downloader
4K Video Downloader is a simple and free application that lets you easily download any song or video on YouTube as long as you have its respective URL. This is a great tool for downloading clips or music to add to your videos. Even if you only want to redownload your own videos, in terms of quality, this actually works better than the download provided by YouTube itself.
